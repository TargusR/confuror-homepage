Every member of Confuror agrees to abide by the Confuror Code of Conduct as a condition of attending the event and receiving a badge. Following the policies below ensures that you and the people around you have a safe and enjoyable convention experience. This code of conduct applies to members of the convention at all event premises, regardless of whether the convention has officially begun or ended. Confuror welcomes all parties with an interest in anthropomorphic animals; however, the convention's management reserves the right to deny or revoke the membership of any individual at any time for any reason. Confuror also reserves the right to amend these rules at any time without prior or posted notice and reserves the sole right of interpretation.

Confuror’s events and function spaces are for the exclusive enjoyment of our members.  Badges shall be worn at all times and are required for event admission. A badge is valid only for the person to whom it was issued and may not be shared under any circumstance. Convention badges are the property of Confuror for the duration of the convention and must be presented and/or surrendered to any Confuror staff member upon request.

Daytime programming content is intended for all ages.  During evening hours, some events may contain strong language or adult themes and will be restricted to mature audiences only; attendees under the age of 18 will not be admitted to these events without a parent or guardian.

## Personal Conduct

Though Confuror is a private event, attendees are expected to conduct themselves in common areas in a manner appropriate for public spaces. Please consider how your actions reﬂect on the convention and how they may impact or affect others. 

Keep in mind that there are always other guests of the hotels and convention areas, especially on the ﬁrst ﬂoor and lobby areas. Offending other hotel’s guests is inappropriate; impressing them with how much fun and enthusiasm we have for our fandom is appropriate. 

Footwear is required in all convention spaces. Individuals not in Full-body costume are required to wear shirts,pants/shorts/skirts or their equivalents. Clothing and costumes must not be overly revealing, lewd, suggestive, or likely to draw reasonable complaint or offense. Collars are acceptable attire, however leashes may not be held by another person. Fursuiters must respect the policies of hotels and other venues regarding areas where costumes are not allowed, which may include restaurants and hotel swimming pools.

Public displays of affection beyond what is appropriate for polite company are frowned upon. Please express your devotion to your significant other either in less conspicuous ways, or in private.

## The following is expressly prohibited at Confuror:​

* Sleeping in common spaces; please return to your hotel room or home.
* Open display of adult artwork.
* Throwing items from any elevated space.
* Water pistols, silly string, or any thrown, flown, or projectile item.
* Affixing any material to walls, elevators, hotel room doors or convention signage
* Indoor or outdoor drone operation.
* Lighter-than-air balloons.
​
Confuror attendees must abide by instructions given by Confuror Security staff. Failure to do so will result in loss of membership privileges. If the convention becomes aware of any of our attendees engaging in illegal activities, either in convention space or in private hotel rooms, we will be forced to inform the proper authorities.

## Sales of goods and services

The offering for sale of any goods or services at the convention may be undertaken only in appropriate and authorized areas; in all cases the sale will be governed by the rules applicable to those areas. Sales may only be made at authorized times, and by registered, authorized Dealerships. It is not permitted to sell goods or services in any other areas.

* * *

# Minors attendees

While our attendee demographic generally consists of young adults and older, Confuror is an all-ages event. If you are not 18 years of age or older (or fail to provide a photo ID with your birthdate at registration), your badge will be marked as a minor, and you will only be allowed admittance to general-audience programming. Please be prepared to show your badge at any time you need access to convention space or events—it identiﬁes you as a fully-paid attendee of the convention.

Minors are not permitted under any circumstances to enter areas designated for mature audiences.

Anyone providing false documentation of identity or age will be denied membership and reported to the police.

## Harassment and Assault

Harassment is any behavior that intentionally annoys or alarms another person. Unintentional or misinterpreted behaviors may also cause feelings of harassment. This includes unwanted physical or verbal contact, following someone in a public area without a legitimate reason, or threatening physical violence. Offenders may lose their badges and the matter may be referred to the proper law enforcement authorities.

Confuror is dedicated to providing a harassment-free environment for all, regardless of age, race, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, or personal beliefs. We do not tolerate harassment of any kind of convention attendees, volunteers, staff, or guests; harassment is considered a serious breach of this code of conduct.  This policy applies equally to attendees, staff, contractors, and agents of Confuror. If someone requests to be left alone, respect their wishes.  Individuals experiencing harassment should contact any member of Confuror staff as soon as possible.
​
Wearing or displaying garments, costumes, or signage that are deemed by Confuror to communicate hostile messaging or sentiment is not permitted anywhere in Confuror spaces. Individuals in violation of this policy will be required to remove such items.

If people tell you "no" or ask you to leave them alone, your business with them is done. The act of wearing a costume or fursuit does not grant license for anybody to make inappropriate or suggestive comments, gestures, or unwanted physical contact with costumed attendees. If you continue to attempt to have contact with those people, you may be removed from the premises. Remember: "A costume does not imply consent."

## Hotel Party Policy

Gatherings in hotel rooms must not generate any noise that can be heard in neighboring rooms during nighttime hours. Hotel doors must be kept shut during such gatherings and guests are not permitted to congregate in the hotel corridors.

Loud parties will be given a single warning to remain quiet. No second warnings will be given before action is taken by the hotel to remove the offending individuals.

Hotel guests who host any gathering are responsible for cleaning up afterward. Excessive amounts of unbagged trash must not be left for housekeeping staff to clean up (it's just plain rude).

* * *

## Other Hotel Matters

Any act of vandalism, deliberate or excessive damage to hotel property, or interference with  hotel or Convention Center workers in the performance of their duties will result in permanent revocation of Confuror membership, criminal prosecution, fines, or any combination thereof.

The person in whose name a room is rented is solely responsible for the conduct of all individuals in the room as well as for the condition of the room. Excessive trash, soiling or other damage to hotel property, or any circumstance that may present a hazard to hotel housekeeping staff may result in permanent loss of Confuror membership privileges.

Requests for room amenities such as towels and pillows beyond the number that is reasonable and customary for a single room will not be honored. Kindly bring such extra items from home if you anticipate the need.

* * *

## Smoking, Alcohol and Substance Abuse

Attendees must comply with venue smoking policies.  Smoking or use of electronic cigarettes is prohibited in any area within Confuror hotel event space, common areas, non-smoking guest rooms, or the convention areas.  Smokers must use designated smoking areas, and cigarette butts must be disposed of properly.

Confuror asks that any bottled alcoholic beverages be brought promptly to hotel rooms for storage or responsible consumption. No alcoholic beverages may be brought into nor consumed in convention space, except during designated programming events.

Confuror does not tolerate serving of alcohol to minors. Alcohol service at parties is permitted only if the party is closed (private). It is the responsibility of the host and registered guests of a room where alcohol is being served at a party to ensure that all persons are over the age of 18, regardless of whether or not those individuals are consuming alcohol. You should also designate someone not to drink, so that there is a fully competent person present to deal with any emergencies that might arise.

The sale, distribution, or use of any illegal or controlled substances is not welcome at Confuror. Any individual found to be distributing such substances will be removed and reported directly to the authorities. Public intoxication is not permitted. Those deemed intoxicated or impaired may be asked to retire to their private hotel room or may be removed from the premises.

## Weapons policy

No functioning or realistic appearing firearm may be carried or displayed in convention space at any time.  Projectile devices or props, which may cause annoyance to others, are not allowed.
​
Edged weapons may be worn as a costume accessory only if they are covered by a sheath that covers all sharp edges and points. The weapon must be secured from removal by a cord or tie (often referred to as “peace bonding”) that is applied or approved by convention security. 
​
Brandishing any weapon for any reason is not allowed, and will result in the confiscation of the weapon for the duration of the convention.
​
Any questions about this regarding the weapons policy should be directed to convention security.
Photography, Video Recording, Media Relations and Use of Confuror’s Images or Footage

Confuror wants you to have great memories from a fantastic convention. Photography, film, and video recording by convention members for personal use is generally allowed in all common areas of the convention with the exception of some events or areas where filming or photography is disallowed. Please consult the program guide at the convention for information relating to speciﬁc events.

Attendees are reminded to be courteous when photographing or filming individuals or costumes — ask permission first. If an individual does not wish to be photographed or filmed, respect their wishes.

All journalists, media photographers, and any other members of the press are required to display an official Confuror’s Press Badge or be accompanied by a senior Confuror staff member at all times while in convention space. Members of the press who have not been issued a Press Badge may not conduct interviews or take photographs, audio or video footage without an escort.

If members of the media are present, attendees must act responsibly. Media representatives who do not have Press Badges and are not escorted by an Confuror staff member should be reported to Confuror Security staff or to Convention Operations immediately. Do not speak to any unbadged and unescorted members of the press!

Confuror members should be aware that audio and/or video recordings are frequently made in convention space and that their likenesses may appear in those recordings. Individual members agree to assign without compensation the use of their likeness(es) at Confuror for the use of promotional material such as the highlights videos.

The name "Confuror" and the Confuror logo are registered service marks of Vidafur A.C., and must not be used in any fashion that disparages or dilutes that mark. Members agree to remove from circulation or publication any image or recording that in the sole opinion of Vidafur A.C. misrepresents or defames its service mark.

## Pet policy

Animals, except service animals are prohibited in hotel common areas. Emotional Support Animals do not fall under this definition.
