Adherence to this code of conduct ensures that you, your companions and friends have the best possible experience during the convention. Maintaining these guidelines benefits us all.

The Organizing Committee reserves the right to deny or revoke access to the convention to any individual at any time at its discretion and in the interest of the safety or well-being of all participants.

## 1) You must wear your official convention badge at all times. It is your pass to enter the halls and events.
- **1.1)** If you are a minor you must be accompanied at all times by a parent or guardian; or have their explicit authorization for someone else to escort you; or have their explicit authorization for you to attend unaccompanied. The only way to verify this is through the [parent or guardian consent forms](/en/minors/).
- **1.2)** If requested by the staff, you must show and make evident the badge. As well as any additional identification or validation that may be requested.
- **1.3)** The possession and validity of the badge is subject to compliance with the rules in this document. The Organizing Committee reserves the right to invalidate or destroy a badge if it considers that the holder has misused it, if their actions have compromised the safety of the event and its attendees, or if their behavior is not conducive to good coexistence.

This code of conduct is not exhaustive. Having fun is important but use common sense: if something is not present in the text it does not mean that it is consequently allowed. Take care of those around you, have fun and enjoy being at home.
