To support their conservation, **Confuror** will carry out different activities to raise funds during its 2020 edition which will be destined to [**Selva Teneek**](http://www.selvateenek.com/), a civil organization that maintains an Environmental Management Unit located in the **Huasteca Potosina** performing rescue, rehabilitation and release labors for all of these wild cats and other species of animals in the region.

They are the first organization founded in the Huasteca Potosina to care for wildlife. Their strategy of combining environmental education with ecotourism has yielded many fruits, since they have two years in operation and **more than 100 specimens assisted**.

This year they are aiming to build the first wildlife veterinary hospital in their area, which will be a great resource for their environmental work. At Confuror we want to help them to make it possible!

With all our hearts, let's show the value of our fandom!
