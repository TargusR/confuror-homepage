**Artists and vendors participation in any of the sales or exhibition categories is conditioned to the acceptance and compliance of these terms and conditions, without exceptions.**.

By *"Authorized Spaces"* we mean the spaces designated within the convention venue for stand assembly and/or item displaying, in any of the available categories; which are **Dealers Den**, **Artist Alley**, **Night Market** and **Art Show**.

Within the *Authorized Spaces*, there are the **Main spaces**, which are those oriented to public of all ages (Dealers Den, Artist Alley and Art Show during the day), and the **Adult Spaces** (Night Market and Art Show during the night), which are those oriented to people over 18 years old.

An "exhibition" is a set of items available for sale or presentation in the above-mentioned categories, regardless of their nature or format.

The rules and guidelines here exposed have been written with the intention of promoting the best experience in the exhibitions development. Each participant is responsible for his/her exhibition, so Confuror and its organizing committee are not responsible for their operations, content or affectations of any kind caused by them.
