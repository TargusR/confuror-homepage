<!-- ABSTRACT for intro -->

This year we are having our second edition of the Confuror Virtual Alley, hosted in our virtual worlds **VRChat** and **Minecraft**. Don't miss the chance to be displayed there! It is completely free and does not require any prior registration for the event.

## Features

- The exhibition will be mounted in the Virtual Alley during Confuror Online 2022 and while the worlds remain online.
- Interactive links will be placed to the websites or social network profiles of your choice.
- It does not require your attention or presence in the virtual space to operate.
- Stands will appear at the same time in VRChat and Minecraft as long as there is availability. (Room in Minecraft for the Virtual Alley is larger than in VRChat, so some stands will only appear there).

<br>

This is how the virtual booths will look like:
