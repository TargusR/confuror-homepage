If you are a minor (under 18 years of age) and wish to attend Confuror, you must present a letter of **informed consent from your parents or legal guardians** as a requirement to participate in the event.

This measure is implemented to ensure your safety and facilitate communication with your legal guardians if necessary. Confuror is a recreational space oriented to different age groups and different expressions of identity. It is our task and commitment to ensure the safety of all attendees, especially those who may be more vulnerable.

Any data requested in the above formats and any attachments requested to be submitted adhere to our [privacy policy](/en/privacy/).

## Parent/Guardian Consent Letter

You must present a duly completed and signed hard copy of any of the following forms, depending on the case that corresponds to you.

### Case 1: Unaccompanied minor

Applies when a minor is authorized directly by his/her parents or legal guardians to attend the event on his/her own and **unaccompanied**. The form must be submitted along with a copy of the authorizing parent's or guardian's ID to validate the authenticity of the signature and permission.

## Reasons for the letter

By providing any of the above documents duly filled out and signed, along with their respective identification measures, you guarantee that:

- **a)** Your parents or guardians are aware of where you are, giving them peace of mind; you also prove that you have obtained their permission to attend the event under any of the above conditions.
- **b)** You provide us with a means of contact in case of emergencies with which we can assist you if required.
- **c)** You guarantee that the person or persons accompanying you (if not directly your parents or legal guardians) are fully trusted by them and that they are aware of your accompaniment.
- **d)** You provide us with confidence that your attendance at the event takes place in safe accompanying conditions for you.

## Free assistance for parents or legal guardians

As a minor, any of your parents or legal guardians may accompany you to the event, entering at no additional cost. When you present yourself at registration along with any of them and their proper identification, they will receive a "Companion" badge that will grant them access to any area of the event to which you have access as a minor.
