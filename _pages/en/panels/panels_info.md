## What is a panel?

One of the main features of a furry convention are the **panels**. Any content proposed by the community that is presented during the convention is considered a panel. In Confuror they are classified as:

- Conferences or talks
- Meetings
- Releases and work presentations
- Concert
- Round tables and discussions
- Workshops
- Group games or activities
- Tournaments (Video Games or Board Games)

Although panels are housed in the convention space, **attendants are the ones who propose and present their content**. If you are looking forward to host any activity during Confuror, continue reading to find out more or submit your proposal following this link:
