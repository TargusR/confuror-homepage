## Requirements:
- You must be registered in the event as an attendee.
- Provide contact information as a host through the form indicated in this call for proposals.
- Provide the information of the panel on the form, detailing in the best possible way the activity to be carried out or the topic to be treated.
- Properly indicate in the form if the panel content includes adult material or topics.

## Rules and restrictions
- Event rules and code of conduct apply to the panel content.
- Drinking alcoholic beverages inside panels is not allowed.
- The consumption of alcoholic beverages will not be allowed during panels unless there is an explicit authorization from the staff to do so (in which case it would be an exclusively +18 activity).
- Smoking inside panels installations is not allowed as well, this include electronic cigarettes and vaporizers.
- All panel proposals are subject to staff review and approval.

## Schedule and time
You will be allowed to indicate a preferred day and time in your application, however, the final schedule allocation will depend on the availability of the spaces in which your panel or proposed activity can be executed.

Activity blocks have a **minimum duration of an hour**, increasing in 30-minute blocks as needed. A margin of at least **10 minutes** should be considered for the closure of any activity. We recommend adding additional time on your application (at least 30 minutes) to ensure an orderly transition.

It is not necessary for a panel or activity to cover the 100% of the allotted time, but it must not invade the 10 minute transition time or any other activity time held in the same space. During execution, hosts must attend the instructions from the staff regarding the time marks.

### Available schedule ranges

- **Morning:** 10:00am a 1:00pm
- **Noon:** 1:00pm a 4:00pm
- **Afternoon:** 4:00pm a 8:00pm
- **Evening:** 8:00pm a 12:00am+

Activities scheduled for 12:00 am may be completed by 2:00 am at the latest. **Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday** will be available for scheduling; we will try to assign as close to the proposed schedule but all time slots and spaces are subject to availability.
