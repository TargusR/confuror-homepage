## Schedule and time
You will be allowed to indicate a preferred day and time in your application, however, the final schedule allocation will depend on the availability of the spaces in which your panel or proposed activity can be executed.

Activity blocks have a **minimum duration of an hour**, increasing in 30-minute blocks as needed. A margin of at least **10 minutes** should be considered for the closure of any activity. We recommend adding additional time on your application (at least 30 minutes) to ensure an orderly transition.

It is not necessary for a panel or activity to cover the 100% of the allotted time, but it must not invade the 10 minute transition time or any other activity time held in the same space. During execution, hosts must attend the instructions from the staff regarding the time marks.

### Available schedule ranges

- **Morning:** 10:00am a 1:00pm
- **Noon:** 1:00pm a 4:00pm

- **Evening:** 8:00pm a 12:00am

Activities scheduled for 12:00 am may be completed by 2:00 am at the latest. Only **Friday, Saturday and Sunday** will be available for scheduling. If you require or wish to schedule your activity on Thursday, please mention it in the form comments for us to take it into consideration; availability of spaces on Thursday is limited.
