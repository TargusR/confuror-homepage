## Sizes and fares

This year we offer two different types of spaces **Tables** and **Stands**. Stands have a limited availability; in case we run out, depending on the evaluation of your application, we will seek further contact with you to offer an alternative based on tables. If your project includes many participants, we recommend uploading more than one application (in pairs) in order to ensure appropriately sized spaces. Each table is limited to two participants.
