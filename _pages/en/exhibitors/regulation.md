%}

**Artists and vendors participation in any of the sales or exhibition categories is conditioned to the acceptance and compliance of these terms and conditions, without exceptions.**.

By *"Authorized Spaces"* we mean the spaces designated within the convention venue for stand assembly and/or item displaying, in any of the available categories; which are **Dealers Den**, **Artist Alley**, **Night Market** and **Art Show**.

Within the *Authorized Spaces*, there are the **Main spaces**, which are those oriented to public of all ages (Dealers Den, Artist Alley and Art Show in it's general section), and the **Adult Spaces** (Night Market and Art Show in it's adult section), which are those oriented to people over 18 years old and where access control is present.

An *"exhibition"* is a set of items available for sale or presentation in the above-mentioned categories, regardless of their nature or format.

The rules and guidelines here exposed have been written with the intention of promoting the best experience in the exhibitions development. Each participant is responsible for his/her exhibition, so Confuror and its organizing committee are not responsible for their operations, content or affectations of any kind caused by them.

Responsibility of each participant is not only limited to the content exhibited, but also to procure at their own expense the supplies and materials such as extensions or mounting accessories that may be considered necessary for their exhibition. Confuror will only provide those materials explicitly detailed in the calls for entries or confirmations of participation.
