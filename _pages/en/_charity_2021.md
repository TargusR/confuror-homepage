To support their conservation, **Confuror** will carry out different activities during its Online 2021 edition, raising funds that will be destined to [**"El Cora" Crocodile Sanctuary**](https://www.facebook.com/cocodrilarioelcora/), who work in the protection and care of wildlife in the **Rivera de Nayarit**, doing wildlife rescue, research and environmental education.

**El Cora Crocodile Sanctuary** is a private organization that maintains a natural space located in the heart of the mangrove swamp in the **Estero El Quelele (Nayarit, Mexico)**. This place is an **Environmental Management Unit** (UMA, spanish acronym) authorized by the Mexican **Secretary of Environment and Natural Resources (Semarnat)**, which provides wildlife conservation, environmental education and eco-tourism.

It offers guided tours where visitors have the opportunity to learn about some important aspects of crocodiles, such as their behavior, their importance to the ecosystem, and their current state of protection. They can also meet some of the crocodiles that live in the reserve and learn about their history. All with the aim of generating awareness, passion and respect for nature.

Thanks to the income generated by the visits, "El Cora" raises the necessary funds to maintain its work of rescue and rehabilitation of wild animals that are reported in the local housing areas, crocodile monitoring in the wetlands of the bay and many other environmental activities.

*"What is known is loved and what is loved is cared for"* is their signature phrase. Their team of biologists and veterinarians is dedicated to promoting knowledge, sharing experiences, and generating respect for animals and ecosystems. This is why Confuror has chosen them as the organization selected for the charity activities during the Online 2021 edition, hoping to raise a piece of what our community has to offer to the Mangroves and Crocodiles of the wetlands of Nayarit.
