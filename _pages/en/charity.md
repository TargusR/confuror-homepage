  content="Different shark species suffer from the cultural stigma of being recognized as hazardous. In reality, it is their very existence that is threatened by human action. Sharks are guardians and regulators of the largest ecosystem on the planet; being aware of their importance and protecting them from extinction is vital to maintaining balance in the oceans."

Joining the cause in favor of sharks, **Confuror** will carry out different activities during its 2022 edition, raising funds that will go to [**Desmitificando Tiburones**](http://desmitificandotiburones.org/), a Mexican association that seeks to educate about the myths and realities of sharks, documenting them in the wild and identifying habits and threats, in order to implement conservation strategies in collaboration with other associations and international programs.
