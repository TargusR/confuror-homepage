**Nutrias de México** is an initiative that seeks to promote the conservation of otter populations in Mexico, based on scientific studies on the ecology and biology of otters that generate knowledge about their natural processes, thus laying the groundwork for establishing conservation and management programs.

In addition to promoting the participation and training of new students and future professionals interested in the study and conservation of otters or the natural environment, this organization seeks to integrate the communities that share habitat with otter populations, carrying out participatory monitoring committees and environmental education events with talks where the importance of otters in their ecosystem and the best practices for their conservation are disseminated.

Joining their cause, **Confuror** will carry out different activities during its 2023 edition, raising funds that will be destined to [**Nutrias de México**](https://www.facebook.com/NutriasDeMexico). The funds raised will be used for their active projects to monitor the population status and distribution of the neotropical otter in the municipality of Tetecala in Morelos and in the municipality of Bacalar in Quintana Roo. As well as its project to evaluate the conflict between fishermen and otters in Mexico, which seeks to establish functional strategies for human and natural communities.
