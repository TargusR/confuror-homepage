Year after year, Confuror gathers graphic art contributed by the community in a printed publication that is distributed free of charge to all attendees during the convention.

In this way we provide everyone at the event with a means to express their creativity, in addition to informing them of the important details of the convention, the venue and its surroundings. All in a full color printed memory where you can also announce projects oriented to the local and international furry community by paying a fee that contributes to fund the Conbook printing.
