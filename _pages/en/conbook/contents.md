Confuror is looking for your artwork, photographs, stories, and articles for publication in our 2023 Conbook.

We are asking for non-exclusive print rights for your submitted works. You, the artist or author, may publish your submitted works in any other fashion, at any time.


## General information

Conbook submissions must be received no later than August 15, 2023. The theme of our 2023 convention is “Science Madness.” It represents science in general, science fiction, mad scientists, crazy experiments, monstrous creations, bizarre machines, and more- all mixed with furry fandom.

All submissions should be rated "G" to "PG-13."

All submissions should include a title, the creator’s real name, and their nickname (if desired).

While not required, we would appreciate it if you include “Yuri, the Opossum,” Confuror’s beloved mascot, in your works.

Linked here is the Artists Guide for this year’s convention, which we hope will be useful to you in producing your works:

### File submissions:

## Artwork and photography.

- Acceptable file formats: JPEG, PNG, PDF or TIFF.

- While not required, we would appreciate it if you include “Yuri, the Opossum”, Confuror’s beloved mascot, in your works.
- Include your signature. We are very appreciate of your work, but above all else we need to be able to acknowledge you as the creator.
