  include {{ site.formats.featured_paragraph }}

  content="If you have a project created for the furry community that you would like to show at Confuror, you can advertise it in our Conbook. All convention attendees receive a copy!"
%}

Ads in the Conbook are recommended for furry artists and creators offering their services, websites, comics, magazines, crowdfunding projects, and more. They can also be used to announce other events for the furry community, such as conventions, furmeets, camps, and markets, among others.


## Rules about content and sizes

The material contained in your ad *must be suitable for all audiences*, without exception to what you are advertising.

Review the content of your ad very carefully before submitting it. The Conbook team will not make changes of any kind to your files.

<div class="container text-center"><img src="/assets/images/ad_size_diagram_en.png" alt="Tama침os de anuncios disponibles" class="img-fluid"></div>

The Conbook will be printed on letter-size paper (8.5 x 11 inches). Ads will be printed alongside other content in the Conbook. Ad pricing varies depending on the page size chosen:

|Size|Measures|Cost|
|:--------|:-------:|--------:|
|1/4 de p치gina|4.25 x 5.5 pulgadas (10.8 x 14 cm)|$1,200 MXN|
|1/2 p치gina|8.5 x 5.5 pulgadas (21.5 x 14 cm)|$2,325 MXN|
|P치gina completa|8.5 x 11 pulgadas (21.5 x 28 cm)|$4,500 MXN|

## How to request an ad?

To request advertising space, please fill out the form linked below.

Once submitted, you will receive a confirmation email no later than July 31 regarding your form. If your ad is accepted, you will also receive payment instructions, which we recommend completing as soon as possible to avoid losing your slot, since ad space in the Conbook is limited.

All communications related to your ad will come from either info@confuror.org or conbook@confuror.org. We will not send any correspondence or confirmation of payment outside of these emails or by private messages.
