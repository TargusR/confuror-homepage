The 5-star Barcel贸 Guadalajara Hotel in Mexico is located in front of the "Expo Guadalajara" Convention Center and next to the World Trade Center business complex. The hotel is 30 minutes from the Miguel Hidalgo International Airport and only 5 kilometers west of the historic Guadalajara downtown.

This 2023 the hotel welcomes Confuror as our new venue. We are very excited to present all the things we will be able to achieve in this new space.
