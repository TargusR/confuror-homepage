We would like to begin by thanking all the people who have written to us offering their support, donating their tickets or proposing a fundraising dynamic. The solidarity that the community has shown towards the event in the midst of this situation shows us how much they appreciate it. But it is also a reminder of the important commitment that we have to take care of and protect this community.

When we started the Confuror project, one of our priorities was to create a space where we could feel the identity of our fandom, which was also safe and comfortable. As we mentioned in our previous communication, this year has represented many challenges. One of them was to be able to maintain that space with safety and comfort in the middle of a situation that compromised it all by itself and put us against the clock to be able to carry out the economic obligations of the convention. This year, with every day that passed, we were less convinced of being able to achieve it and less willing to keep going.

The latest statements made by government agencies have enabled us to move in the direction we most desired: to move forward to a safer and more favourable year for all of us. This is why today we can announce with confidence that **all Confuror 2020 presential activities to be held in Guadalajara Jalisco are suspended**. In favor of the protection and comfort of our attendees, we have been able to reach an agreement with our venue and suppliers, who have been attentive from the beginning and in the face of the most current panorama has given us a green flag to proceed with this change, moving all our resources and hiring to 2021.

**Confuror 2020 will be 100% digital, open for everyone and free of charge**. We believe that this is the best measure we can take to prevent any consequences on the health of our attendees or their families, because although we strongly hope that the risk of contagion will decrease in the coming days or months, we do not wish to represent a risk.

In order to facilitate adjustments to your plans, we are also anticipating the dates of the next Confuror edition, which will take place from **October 28th to 31st in 2021**, at the Fiesta Americana Hotel in Guadalajara.



### What will happen to the Confuror 2020 active tickets?

**All memberships that were in effect for Confuror 2020 will be valid for Confuror 2021**, retaining all its benefits as if attendees had been originally registered for the new dates.

Similarly, **all memberships that were donated to Confuror will be reactivated for Confuror 2021**. Donors will still receive a commemorative pin in appreciation of their support along with their 2021 access pack. For risk prevention and in order to reduce the logistical burden, no souvenirs will be produced or shipped during this year.

Memberships that were previously transferred during this year and that already have their coupon for 2021, should be reactivated later by redeeming the coupon. Detailed instructions will be given later. **If you transferred your membership in the last few days, but do not have a coupon yet, you will not need to take any further action**, your membership will remain active and will be valid for 2021.

Our email address **reg@confuror.org** and our social networks will be attentive to any clarification you need to make regarding your registration.

### What will happen with the *Lucha Libre* theme?

We want to keep the *Lucha Libre* theme this year during our digital edition. We believe that the strength of the theme is just what we need to encourage the fight against this health threat and the repercussions it has. That's why we invite the community to continue producing art and content with it. To put on our *Luchador* masks this coming October 9, 10 and 11 in our social networks, letting the Internet finding us celebrating our community even from home.

**The *Lucha Libre* theme will return in the future** We want a rematch in a face-to-face event. We won't tell you when right now, but we assure you it will be soon. For 2021 we have another surprise planned that we will announce during our online event this year.


## Take care of yourself! We want to see you in Confuror 2021

It's time to take care of ourselves. We want to see you again here in Guadalajara, whether it's in 2021 or later. That is why today more than ever it is important to do everything possible to prevent this threat from continuing to spread. By fighting together, we will win. See you online!

Your home awaits you.
