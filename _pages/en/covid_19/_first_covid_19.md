Although it's quite a few months away, we have decided to open this communication channel in order to keep you posted on our decisions regarding our 2020 convention."

A lot of events happening in between March and May have had to be postponed or cancelled due to their local conditions and the current uncertainty. As much as it overwhelms us, as members of the furry community, we know that it is necessary to combat the problem we face. We must stand in support with the staff of these events, because the decisions they had gone through must have been complicated, and may certainly risk their economic stability. Still, they are doing the right thing. We also invite you to support the artists and creators in the community. For many of them, these events represented an important economic resource. We believe they' ll be more than grateful to receive commissions in these months. We know that the present days are complicated, what we are living through is beyond our grasp and affects us in many ways, but we have the strength and the capacity to move forward, as a society and as a fandom. **This isolation does not really break us apart**.

Taking into consideration the current dates for sanitary measures established and the new dates to which the massive events where postponed in Jalisco, we are confident that the picture for the second half of the year will be much more favorable than the current one. And that we can continue with the planned dates for our event as normally as possible.

**Confuror 2020 will keep its dates in October, the 9th, 10th and 11th**. Unless the sanitary conditions do not improve in the next months, in which case we will announce with enough anticipation any change in the progress of the event.

We must remain calm in order to not worsen the situation with side issues such as the shortage of basic supplies or the saturation of health services, and to comply with the measures recommended by the authorities to prevent contagion. We must take care of ourselves and our loved ones. That is everyone's task.

We will be in touch to update you on any new information. Thank you for your attention to this statement.

<p class="signature">Confuror 2020 direction board.</p>
