Do you want your work to be recognized? Send us your best artwork, any of your pieces are welcome, although we will give priority to those that are **DÃ­a de Muertos** themed or it's prehispanic american roots. These are the requirements to participate:

- The pieces must be illustrations or photographies related to the **Furry Fandom**.
- The pieces must be *SFW* (suitable for *all the public*). Censoring *NSFW* (adult content) is not enough for it to be allowed.
- **You should frame your image within a 900 x 1200 pixel rectangle**, (like the one shown on this page and its examples) either vertically or horizontally. It doesn't matter if you crop or leave negative space. Just fill it with the color or decoration of your preference (don't leave any transparent pixels).
- Files must be JPG or PNG without transparencies.
- Avoid placing text or text links on images, we will use interactive tags to link to your Art-show or page of preference.
