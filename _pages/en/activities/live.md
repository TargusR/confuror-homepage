## How does it works?

During Confuror 2023 there will be intermissions in which our screens will randomly show the videos submitted to this list. This way, while our spaces are preparing for any activity changes, the Confuror audience and attendees will be able to watch them. These videos will also be broadcasted in our livestream.

To participate, all you have to do is record a short video following the specifications described here and register it using the form we provide below. If the video meets the requirements and is chosen, it will appear on our screens during the intermissions of the convention and will also appear in our livestream during the event. In this way, your video will be able to reach both the in-person and virtual audience of Confuror 2023.


## Video clip specifications

- All videos must be recorded in landscape format.
- The minimum resolution must be 1920 x 1080 pixels.
- It is recommended that the video's minimum length be 1 minute; however, it cannot exceed 5 minutes, except in cases where it is a collaborative video, for which the allowed length limit will be 10 minutes.
- The content must be suitable for all audiences.
- You must own all rights to the content presented or, failing that, use music, image or video resources that are authorized for creative use ("royalty free").
- The edited content must be unpublished; that is, the cut or edition must not have been previously published on any social network; however, you may reuse fragments of video that you have already shown previously by any means.
- You may promote your social networks, project or brand identity (if you have one), but this must not be the central theme of the video.
- The video must be free of text or images superimposed in the corners. To identify you, we will add your name and social network.

## Recommendations and considerations

- You can enter as many videos as you like, but only one video will be selected for each participating creative. Group videos will not preclude the additional selection of individual videos from their participants.
- You should record in a place where there is no outside noise to ensure clear audio, especially if you intend to include a voice message.
- Avoid using your computer's built-in microphone to capture voice. If you do not have a microphone, you can use the microphones built into headsets.
- All videos submitted and selected will be included in our broadcast on a non-exclusive basis; this means that all content belongs to its creators and each retains its rights of use intact. We only ask that if you register a video, do not publish it on your networks until the event is over.
- You must register your video using the form we present here from the date of publication of this announcement and until **October 8th**.
