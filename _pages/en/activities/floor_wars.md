## Battle dynamics
When the participant steps onto the dance floor, a randomly chosen track from the 4 provided by the participant will start. They must perform the dance corresponding to that track or improvise. At the end of the track selected (30 - 60 seconds), their opponent will perform their own dance using a randomly selected track from their own set. The judges' evaluation will point to a winner between the two, and the winner will move on to the next round.

In each round the winners of the previous rounds will face each other, the tracks of their set will be played randomly without repetition. During the casting, the best 16 participants will be selected and will compete in the first round. The best 8 will move on to the "Round of eight". From this round, the best 4 will move on to the "Quarterfinals", and from this round the two Final competitors will be defined.

All those registered must present themselves at the casting or they will be disqualified. Those selected will be announced that same night.

The most important thing about this battle is to have fun! You will be able to dance freely and show how you move on stage, encourage your friends and keep the good vibes going!
