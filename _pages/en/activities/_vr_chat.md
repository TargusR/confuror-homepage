## How to access Confuror VRChat Furry Family Ofrenda?

## What is the Furry Family Ofrenda?

**The Furry Family Ofrenda** is a memorial project inspired by **el Día de muertos** tradition, it began by ["the Prancing Skiltaire family"](https://en.wikifur.com/wiki/The_Prancing_Skiltaire) in 2018 with the intention of bringing together in one space the remembrance of lovable members of the furry community who are no longer with us. It was installed in 2018 and 2019 during **PAWcon in San Jose, California**. The Ofrenda was moved to VR Chat during the pandemic, inaugurating its memorial virtual world in 2020.

In 2021, as part of our thematic Día de Muertos tribute, Confuror joins the project and is pleased to host an updated version of the ofrenda in our VR Chat World. As Mexicans, we are very honored that our traditions reach other countries to be appreciated and arouse interest, as this is how we believe traditions are and will be kept alive through time.

We hope that our viewpoint for el Día de Muertos would bring the community closer to this tradition and that the Furry Family Ofrenda project will endure as a gathering point for the memory of all the people who brightened our lives in this great community and who deserve to be remembered forever.
