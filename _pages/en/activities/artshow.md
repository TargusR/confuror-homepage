## Selling artwork

If you choose to offer your piece for sale, you will be asked to include contact details that we can display publicly for your prospective buyers. The sale is yours and so is the profit. **Confuror will not intervene in the negotiation process and is not responsible for any sale or exchange**. In the event that one of your pieces is sold during the event, you must present yourself with your ID to pick it up and deliver it to the buyer or notify us as soon as possible so that we can mark it as sold if you plan to exhibit it for a longer period of time and have agreed on a later delivery date. Only the artist-exhibitor will be able to pick up the pieces upon presentation of their ID and it is their responsibility to follow up on the status of the pieces.

## Joining the charity auction

If you choose to donate the piece to the charity auction, it will automatically be brought to the auction at the close of the gallery. **The auction will take place on Sunday at 6:00pm at Main Stage**. The piece will be sold to the highest bidder and will be delivered to the highest bidder upon verification of payment of the amount bid. Your accreditation information will be announced to the public along with the piece during this auction. 100% of the funds from the sale will be donated to charity, this percentage is non-negotiable.

You may indicate a base bid amount, the auctioneer will try to raise the bid from the public but will negotiate the amount if necessary in order to ensure the sale. Only in the extraordinary case that the piece is not sold, you will be able to pick it back up at the end of the auction by presenting your ID.
