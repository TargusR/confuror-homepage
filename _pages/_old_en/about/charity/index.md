It is one of the institutions in Mexico responsible for the reproduction and rescue of the **Mexican gray wolf**, which is a threatened species. However, the funds it receives for the fulfillment of its work are very limited, it has been thanks to the donations that it has been able to get ahead

#### You can help them!

Confuror will raise funds during its next 2019 edition through dynamics and special events that will allow attendees and stakeholders to contribute to their mission to learn more about the Mexican wolf and help it gain ground in its fight against extinction.

Wholeheartedly, let's show the value of our fandom!
