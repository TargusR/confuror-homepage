#### How can I include my works?

Bring your artwork on **Thursday, October 10 after 5:00 p.m.** at the convention's operation center, or **during the exhibition days (Friday or Saturday)**.

We will provide you a form to fill in order to register your piece. Authors that choose to not participate in the auction may pick their pieces back on Sunday at the operations center. **If you choose to include your artwork in the charity auction, you can opt to receive a payout percentage of the final offer for your piece, which cannot be greater than 40% of the sale**, as well as set the desired starting bid. If the piece does not receive any bids, it will be returned to the author on Sunday at the end of the auction.

  message="By including your works in the gallery <strong>you are not compromised to include them in the auction as well</strong>, the auction is completely optional, available for those who want to contribute to the charity fundation sponsored by the convention."

#### What pieces will be included in the auction?

Only those whose authors have explicitly accredited in their artwork registration format. Auction candidate pieces may receive votes during the exhibition days. The number of votes will determine which pieces will have priority to be auctioned. We will try to auction as many pieces as possible, but time is a limitation.
