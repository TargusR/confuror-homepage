## What is a panel?

One of the most relevant things that happen inside a furry convention are the **panels**. A panel is usually a group of people joined together to chat, analyze and discuss a topic, but in furry conventions, panels are also used to socialize and share different experiences. Them are mostly presented in these forms:

- Conferences with aperture for discussion.
- Reunions summoned around a topic or fanbase for species, artists, fursuit makers, hobbies, or;
- Small workshops from a variety of artistic disciplines.

Even when panels are hosted in the convention spaces, the content is provided by the attendees who proposed and presented their ideas. If you are thinking in something that could turn into a great panel, keep reading to know how can you become an **expositor at Confuror 2019**.
