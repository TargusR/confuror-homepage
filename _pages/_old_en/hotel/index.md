Confuror 2019 has a new venue, the grand [**Fiesta Americana Guadalajara**](https://www.fiestamericana.com/web/fiesta-americana-guadalajara) hotel, located right in front of the famous **La Minerva** roundabout and just a few blocks from the _paseo Chapultepec_, night life where the first Confuror edition took place.

### More space, more comfort and closer to where fun is

Looking foward to improve Confuror 2019 experience, we decided to take a big leap as soon as the opportunity presented and we changed the previously chosen venue. Now we have even more space than at the Hilton Hotel, so no one is left out this year.

### New ways to get your room

This year we offer you two methods to book a room in the main hotel. You can book through the **convention room blocking** using the link and code we provide to do so. Or you can buy a **Confuror Club Pass** access, which will not only give you access to the event as a general assistant to you and a companion, but will also include a room paid for three nights in our hospitality floor "Fiesta Club", a special gift with mexican flavor, a custom invitation to the exclusive party in the presidential suite and the advantage of being close to the best nightlife at the convention.

Get more details about both methods through these links:
