## What is a volunteer?

Volunteers are people who support the staff during the event to perform the tasks necessary for the convention to function properly. In exchange for their help, they may be creditors of various benefits during this or the next convention edition.

Being a volunteer **is a commitment that involves working for a few hours in the event**, so before filling out the application, check well what we request.

- Volunteers will work **8 hours per day, divided into two 4 hours blocks**, so that for every 4 hours you work supporting the event, you will have another 4 free hours to enjoy the activities available at Confuror 2019.
- The volunteers undertake to fulfill their obligations during their working hours. The tasks that we will assign will be simple, mainly focused on visitor orientation and event monitoring.
- Volunteers agree to appear on time in the assigned areas and not to abandon them before the end of their shift.
