  Thanks for your interest in the event! To set your registration up follow the instructions on this page.
steps:
  - Fill out the form that appears in the link at the end of this page (after the counter disappears). If you register more than one person, use the "Add Registrant" option after saving the data of the first registration you enter. You must enter real information for all attendees. Duplicate records will be ignored.
  - Once the form is completed, select "Proceed to billing" to go to the payment screen. You can pay instantly with a credit or debit card, or pay offline requesting a PayPal invoice.
  - If you select to request a PayPal invoice, you must complete your payment in no more than 2 business days or the registrations will be canceled (acounting once invoice is received). Once we validate the payment, your registration card will reach your email.
  - If you pay instantly with a credit or debit card, the system will instantly display your registration card with an assistant ID and a QR code so you can check in at the event in October.
  - Check in to the event with your registration card in October and one personal ID to validate your name and date of birth as you entered it in the registration form. If you are a minor, you also have to bring your parents consent letter depending on the case that applies. More information about this document will arrive by mail.
