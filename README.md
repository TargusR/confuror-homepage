Confuror front page source code

## Setup dev dependencies

First make sure you have ruby installed in your sistem.

To know more about ruby instalation, check [Ruby download](https://www.ruby-lang.org/es/downloads/)

Then make sure you have yarn installed before running.

To install Yarn in OSX run:

```$ brew install yarn```

To install yarn in other OS check the [documentation](https://yarnpkg.com/es-ES/docs/install)

Finally install the jekyll gem in your system, using a terminal run:

```$ gem install bundler jekyll```

## Comands in the make file

This project uses a makefile to compile the code and start the jekyll server. All you need to do is run:

```$ make serve```

This will install all other dependencies for this project, then will run the jekyll compilation and start a virtual server, also will watch for changes in the source code, updating the page automatically.

This help file is a WIP, if you are developing for Confuror.org send me a message at targusr@live.com.mx and I will try to help you.
