We are back!

March is almost over and that brings us closer and closer! During the announcements of our 2021 virtual event we revealed the dates for our back to in-person event tentative in 2022. Although the beginning of the year showed a doubtful outlook due to the spikes in COVID contagions, the outlook that closes this first quarter of the year seems to us quite reliable and allows us to take a step forward in the return to face-to-face activities.

That is why today we can announce that **Confuror 2022 is ready to be held in person in October, from the 20th to the 23rd**. The same dates we previously announced! Of course, at the Fiesta Americana Hotel in Guadalajara, Mexico.

If you registered as an attendee for the original 2020 event, or during 2021 while waiting for the in-person return, **your registration is valid for 2022 and you don't need to do anything to activate it**. In the next few days all our pre-registered attendees will receive an email with this confirmation. If you are not yet registered and wish to attend to this edition, you will be able to pre-register soon. We are fine tuning the last details and we are planning to launch the pre-registration forms again during April.

We will soon release more details about the sanitary measures that we will ask attendees to take at all times during Confuror 2022. As well as an overview of the activities we plan to carry out during these convention days.

It's time to come back home...

And we are waiting for you.
