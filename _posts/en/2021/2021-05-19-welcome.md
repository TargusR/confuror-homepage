We have been working in updating the website, preparing it for what is ahead with Confuror 2021 and adding new features. One of these new features is this blog, with which we hope to be able to **share news about what is happening with the event, reveal progress and maintain a central communication channel with its attendees**.

The news and announcements that are published here will be disseminated in turn in social networks. For the moment the only official way to subscribe to this blog is through our networks; although we hope to present a different alternative in the future for those who may find it more convenient. Without further ado, we bid you farewell, inviting you to stay tuned to our networks because we have big announcements to make in the coming days.
