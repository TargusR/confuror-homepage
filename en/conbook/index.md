Year after year, Confuror brings together graphic art and literature contributed by the convention enthusiasts in a printed publication that is distributed free to every attendee.

This is our aim to create a mean for the comunity to express their creativity, as well as informing convention attendees about the important details of the event, the venue and its surroundings. All in a color printed memory where you can also advertise projects aimed at the local and international furry community through a contribution that helps to finance the printing.

## Send your art today!
