Our Conbook is a letter sized, full color, printed publication edited during the event production, presenting the program, activity details, venue city recommendations, but most importantly, it hosts a compilation of pictures, illustrations, stories and articles submitted by the attendees and enthusiasts of the convention.

It’s also an opportunity to advertise the work and services from artists, fursuit makers or freelancers inside the Furry Fandom community to our convention audience, because the printed conbook is distributed to every attendee as part of it’s access goods.
