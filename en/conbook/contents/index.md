We are seeking for submissions of artwork, drawings, illustrations, photographies, stories, tales or articles concerning the furry scene for publication on our 2018 Conbook. Either if you are a plastic artist or a storyteller, you came to the right place.

Confuror asks for non-exclusive print rights for the submitted works. The artist or author may publish the submitted work in any other fashion; previous to publication, at the same time the conbook is being edited or right after the convention is being held. We don't charge or take any benefits from this, all we are looking for is to distribute and let great fandom creators be known through our conbook.
