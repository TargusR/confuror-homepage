  <p><b>Note on Jan/12/19:</b> It seems that the hotel administration did not enabled rooms for the convention block in the subsystem that manages USD as currency. That made the system to report no availability while browsing in english. The issue is fixed now but it might take up to 4 days to update properly. If you attempt to book a room after Jan/16/19 using the english version of the page and see no availability yet, please report the issue via mail to <a href="mailto:vidafur.reg@gmail.com">vidafur.reg@gmail.com</a> so we can make a clarification. If you dont have problems with using a web translator, rooms can be booked in the spanish version of the page without issues, just keep present that fees will be presented in MXN currency while using the spanish version of the page.</p>
