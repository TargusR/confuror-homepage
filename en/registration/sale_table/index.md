Welcome to every artist or dealer to Confuror 2018, to get a spot at our sale spaces it is required to follow the steps in this page. We recommend you to carefully read the instructions below, response time is not as important as answer’s content in this application. Let’s go!

1. Check that all the material you are going to present at Confuror 2018 comply with the requirements mentioned in our current Sales regulation. You can read the corresponding section [here](/en/about/sales/#accepted_content).
2. We would love to know your talent! Keep at hand links to your online public galleries: Instagram, Twitter, Tumblr, Deviant Art Furaffinity, etc; any website is valid as long we can access it’s content for revision. It is not required that every piece submitted to your galleries comply with the requirements mentioned above, just point us to the examples that match the best with what you will exhibit at Confuror in your application form using the corresponding text spaces.
3. If you don’t have any gallery online showing samples of your material publicly, you can upload sample pictures to a cloud album (Google drive, One drive or similar) and share us the link to view them. You can also use this to share photos of WIPs and prototypes of your products that you would like to show us.
4. When you get everything prepared, access the form in the link at the bottom of this page and fill up the required data.

We recommend you to ensure that you have covered every aspect of your products in your description, textually and visually, before sending the data to us. We will only accept one application per artist or seller, duplicated applications will be ignored.
5. Once you have submitted your data, wait until July 20 to know the results. There will be no mail response beside the copy of answers the form automatically sends to your mail address, unless we have a clarification with your data.
6. If you get accredited to a sale spot, pay as quick as possible the table fare with the data we will indicate by mail (about $4 usd) and your access to the event.
