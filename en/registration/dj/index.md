## Be one of the Rave Party DJs in Confuror 2018

The time has come to move the fur on the dance floor and you can be the one setting up the tracks. If you have experience setting up events, mixing or composing music that can be used to dance, you can be one of the Confuror 2018 DJs.

Send us a sample of your work, either through files in the cloud, a playlist of youtube, bandcamp or any platform where we can listen to it publicly and if selected, if we pick you up, you will have control of the Confuror 2018 Rave Party for a glorious moment.

If you are not registered for the event and you are still interested in having your music or mixes in the Confuror party, we can make room for you to register. We are waiting for your request! Application closes on **September 28.**

### Requirements

- Be 18 or older
- Have a sample of their mixes or compositions that can be heard publicly from any online platform.
- Previous experience setting events (preferable to have a sample video).

### About the musical genres

We have some requirements about what we would like to hear this year at the Rave Party.

If your mixes or tracks are alike to the previous genres, you are one step closer to be one of the Confuror 2018 DJs, but it is not a limitation if not, maybe we like much more what you show to us about your work, let us listen a little, fill your application today!
