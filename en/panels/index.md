## What is a panel?

One of the most relevant things that happen inside a furry convention are the **panels**. In the conference world, a group of people joined together to chat, analyze and discuss a topic it’s called a panel.

In furry conventions, **panels** are used to socialize and share different experiences. Them are mostly presented in these forms:

- Conferences with aperture for discussion.
- Reunions summoned around a topic or fanbase for species, artists, fursuit makers, hobbies, or;
- Small workshops from a variety of artistic disciplines.
