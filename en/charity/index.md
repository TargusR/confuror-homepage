**Rescate Zarigüeyal** (or “Opposum Rescue”) is an organization whose main goal is to help preserve wildlife through environmental education and science, proposing and implementing solutions for the preservation of the environment and the sustainable use of natural resources. We are firmly convinced that only through education can we really achieve a lasting change, since we would not only be preserving the environment and all of the beings which inhabit it, but also only through the sharing of knowledge can we improve as a society in cultural, social, political and economical aspects too.

Because, after all, being in harmony with our natural environment allows us to be able to respect life in all its manifestations. We do this by understanding our traditions and giving them a new value, focused in a better use of our natural resources. This is why, through our activities, such as educational talks and ecological workshops, we try to stir the conscience and stimulate the love and interest we have lost for our Mother Earth in all of our participants.

Among the activities in which our organization stands out, we undertake rescue of wild animal life, especially those animals which are often mistreated or towards which the common populace doesn’t show any special concern, such as opossums. These are one of the species which have better adapted themselves to their urban surroundings because of the systematic destruction of their habitat. Many of the specimens we have received in our facilities have already suffered the attacks of dogs, cats and humans, sometimes with little to no hope of survival. This generates orphaned offspring, which we take care of as they grow up, and we generate adaptation routines so that they can be reintegrated in their natural habitats far away from urban areas.

All of this implies a huge amount of work for the personnel in our organization, since those of us who conform it come from all walks of life: students, parents, laborers, housekeepers, and we all have different activities in our daily life besides helping wildlife as volunteers.

Given that we have no facilities of our own to safeguard the animals, we have had to adapt rooms and spaces in our homes to shelter and feed them and provide the attention they require. We have been duly authorized by **SEMARNAT (Mexican Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment)** which is the entity in charge of regulating activities involving wildlife and which gathers and compiles information and data on each individual specimen we receive and set free.

Operative expenses are covered through voluntary financial support and in-kind donations. We usually attend events and sell some products which Mexican companies or enterprises provide us, therefore helping us with a certain percentage of sales. Nevertheless, at the end of the day, many of the expenses are covered by us volunteers. This is why your donation is greatly valued and appreciated, so that we may continue our work in favor of these animals and to build awareness about the species we take care of, the threats to their livelihood, and the importance of caring for our environment and preserving balance in nature.

“We cannot protect that which we don’t know”. So, in order to keep on spreading the knowledge, we need your help. Thank you for your support!
